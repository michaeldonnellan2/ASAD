#April 1
Today I plan to mimic the homepage of the Rockhurst website.

Today I didn't get very far. I got mixed up on some of the code. I need to look at some more Bootstrap code so I am familiar with some of the shortcuts. I don't think the page will be difficult to build, but I just need to be a little more familiar with HTML.
